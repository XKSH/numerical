\subsection*{Description}

Almost everyone nowdays are directly in contact with numerical methods, most of the time unknowingly. For me this course is to get better understanding for the fundamentals of numerical methods in computing. The methods written here are not optimized and most likely they are not even near to professional level.

\subsection*{Methods}

Following methdos are preliminary planned to be studied, with an example of their uses.

\subsubsection*{Root finding}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Bisection
\item Secant
\item Relaxation
\item Newton-\/\+Rhapson
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{Linear algebra}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Gauss
\item L\+U-\/decomposition
\item Relaxation
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{Derivative}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Forward
\item Backward
\item Central
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{Integration}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Rectangle
\item Trapezoid
\item Simpson
\item Monte-\/\+Carlo
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{Differential}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
