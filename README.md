# Numerical methods course
## Description
Almost everyone nowdays are directly in contact with numerical methods, monst of the time unknowingly. For me this course is to get deeper understanding for the fundamentals of numerical methods in computing. 

## Methods 
Following methdos are preliminary planned to be studied, with an example of their uses.
### Root finding
* Bisection
* Secant
* Relaxation
* Newton-Rhapson

### Linear algebra

### Derivative
* Forward
* Backward
* Central

### Integration
* Rectangle
* Trapezoid
